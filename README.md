building customised AI by using already existing LLMs in Ollama. 

Now whats happening here is that there are already a plenty of pre existing , well trained LLMs Large Language Models and are available for free . here I have used an open source LLMs server called Ollama and in that I have used Llama2 . there are plenty of other LLMs available for free . and the beauty of these are that you don't even need to code or you don't need any internet access for these to work , they can run of command prompt in your laptop or PC locally . they can also be customised and can perform tasks that you want them to do , like you will be able to upload pdfs and they can give you outputs as pdfs as well and much much more . 

Here in this repo I am trying to customize the models to my needs and give them an app like UI UX and etc.... . And I am also trying to make them a cloud based engine to allow them to access websearches and perform pretty much like chatgpt or atleast its older versions. by making them cloud based I will be able to use free cloud GPU and will be able to make use of much complex models like Llama3.2 and etc... .
